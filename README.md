# Boba Index

## Overview
The **Boba Index** is a project that analyzes the price of bubble tea across different cities to measure **purchasing power parity (PPP)** and economic trends. Inspired by the Big Mac Index and the Soup Dumpling Index, this dataset provides insights into how local currency values, demand elasticity, and cost structures affect the affordability of boba worldwide.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **City**: The location where the price was recorded
- **Currency Code**: The local currency used
- **Local Price**: The price of bubble tea in local currency
- **USD Price**: The price converted to U.S. dollars for comparison

### Sample Data
| City         | Currency | Local Price | USD Price |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Tokyo       | JPY      | 900        | 5.98      |
| Sydney      | AUD      | 10.3       | 6.40      |
| Beijing     | CNY      | 20         | 2.75      |
| Taipei      | TWD      | 70         | 2.13      |
| New York    | USD      | 6.25       | 6.25      |
| London      | GBP      | 6.21       | 7.76      |
| Singapore   | SGD      | 6.6        | 4.89      |
| Mexico City | MXN      | 108        | 5.26      |
| Seoul       | KRW      | 6300       | 4.31      |
| Manila      | PHP      | 125        | 2.16      |

## Key Insights
- **Most Expensive Cities**: London ($7.76) and Sydney ($6.40) indicate higher costs due to rent and labor.
- **Most Affordable Cities**: Taipei ($2.13) and Manila ($2.16) suggest stronger purchasing power in local currencies.
- **Demand Elasticity**: High-income cities like New York and London sustain premium prices, while competitive markets like Taipei keep prices low.
