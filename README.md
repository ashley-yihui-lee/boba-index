# Boba Index

## Overview
The **Boba Index** is a project that analyzes the price of bubble tea across different cities to measure **purchasing power parity (PPP)** and economic trends. Inspired by the Big Mac Index, this dataset provides insights into how local currency values, demand elasticity, and cost structures affect the affordability of boba worldwide.

## Dataset
The pricing data was sourced from food delievery apps, including Uber Eats, Foodpanda and Meituan. These platforms provide real-time pricing from various vendors, ensuring accurate and up-to-date comparisons.
The dataset includes:
- **City**: The location where the price was recorded
- **Currency Code**: The local currency used
- **Local Price**: The price of bubble tea in local currency
- **USD Price**: The price converted to U.S. dollars for comparison
